    :::info

    If you enable **Blocking**, Identity Server will wait for the
    response from the Identity Provider to continue.

    If you enable **Enable Rules** and **Blocking,** blocking will block
    the provisioning till the rule completely evaluates and get the
    response back to the WSO2 IdP. Afterwards, you need to enable the
    XACML policy. For more information, see [Rule-Based
    Provisioning](../../../../guides/identity-lifecycles/rule-based-provisioning/)
