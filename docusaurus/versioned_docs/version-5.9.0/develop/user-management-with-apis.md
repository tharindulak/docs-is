# User Management with APIs

WSO2 Identity Server provides the following web services APIs for
managing users and roles in the **Remote User Management API:**

-   [RemoteUserStoreManagerService](../../develop/managing-users-and-roles-with-apis)
    : This service exposes user, user role and claim management
    functionalities. For instance, if your application needs a user role
    management function, you can directly integrate with the WSO2
    Identity Server instead of dealing with the user store.  
      
-   [RemoteClaimManagerService](../../develop/managing-claims-with-apis) : This
    service exposes more claim management functionalities such as add,
    and delete claim mappings.  
      
-   RemoteProfileConfigurationManagerService: This exposes functionality
    of profile management features such as add, update, delete profile
    configuration.  
-   [RemoteAuthorizationManagerService](../../develop/managing-users-and-roles-with-apis)
    :  This service exposes functionality of handling authorization of
    users to different resources.  
      
-   [UserStoreConfigAdminService:](../../develop/managing-user-stores-with-apis)
    This service exposes user store configuration functionalities such
    as add, edit, and delete user stores.
