Do the following to try out the REST APIs with your local instance of WSO2 Identity Server. 

   1.  Click on **Authorize** button and provide desired values for authentication. 
   2.  Expand the relevant API operation and click the **Try It Out** button.  
   3.  Fill in relevant sample values for the input parameters and click **Execute**. 
        You will receive a sample curl command with the sample values you filled in. 
   4. Add a `-k` header to the curl command and run the curl command on the terminal with a running instance of WSO2
     IS. 
     
#### If you want to try-out the embedded postman collection with "Run in Postman" option, following state is expected in the testing Identity Server.

   1. A user named `john`, with the password `pass123`, exists in the tenant `carbon.super`.
   2. The id value for the local user association `john` is used for some API calls, which is assumed as 
   `UFJJTUFSWS9qb2hu`(This value is returned when a GET request is made to `/me/associations`(or 
   `/{user-id}/association`) API, once the association between `john` and `admin` users are created with the POST 
   request to the `/me/associations` API).
   3. An IdP with the name `ExternalIdP`, exists in the tenant `carbon.super`.
   4. A federated association with a user in the above IdP, exists for the `admin` user. The id of this 
   association(which is equal to `2e053351-0d69-476e-81df-04a9cfdfb50e` in the provided postman samples) is used 
   for some API calls. This id can be retrieved by making a GET request to the `/me/federated-association`(or 
   `/{user-id}/federated-association`) API.
