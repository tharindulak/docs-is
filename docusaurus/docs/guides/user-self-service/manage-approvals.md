To view the approvals, you can navigate to the **Approvals** section from the My Account Portal side menu.



<Applies to="WSO2 Cloud">

Depending on the type of administrator, approvals can be handled as follows:

- **Privileged user** – These administrators have business user accounts and can manage approvals through the organization’s MyAccount portal.
- **Organization owners and invited administrators** – These administrators do not have business user accounts and therefore cannot access the organization-specific MyAccount portal. They can manage approvals directly from the Console.

</Applies>



This page displays all approval requests that you are eligible to act on.

### Approval states

Each approval request can be in one of the following states:

- **Ready**: The approval request is available for assignment. You can either approve it immediately or reserve it for review later.
- **Reserved**: You have assigned yourself this approval for review. Other approvers can't act on it until you unassign it.
- **Blocked**: Another approver has already reserved this request, so you can't act on it.
- **Approved**: You have approved the request.
- **Rejected**: You have rejected the request.

:::note

Once you reserve (assign yourself) an approval, no one else can approve it. However, you can unassign a reserved approval back to the shared pool at any time, allowing other eligible approvers to act on it.
