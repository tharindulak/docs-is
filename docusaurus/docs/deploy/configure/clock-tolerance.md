# Configure clock tolerance for My Account and Console

The `clockTolerance` parameter can be configured for both the Console and the My Account portal to manage slight clock mismatches between WSO2 Identity Server and clients. This setting helps avoid issues in scenarios where the system’s time is not perfectly aligned.

To configure clock tolerance, add the following configurations to the `deployment.toml` file found in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` folder.

- For the **Console**,

    ```yaml
    [console]
    idp_configs.clockTolerance = <value_in_seconds>
    ```

- For the **My Account** portal,

    ```yaml
    [myaccount]
    idp_configs.clockTolerance = <value_in_seconds>
    ```

:::note[Important]


It is strongly recommended to synchronize the clocks of the servers or virtual machines (VM) running WSO2 Identity Server with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. Time discrepancies across servers can cause issues with authentication, token validation, session expiration, and other time-sensitive operations.
